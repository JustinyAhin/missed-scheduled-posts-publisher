Are your scheduled posts not publishing? This plugin fixes the missed schedule error and triggers your scheduled posts to publish without impacting performance.

== Description ==

= WordPress Missed Scheduled Plugin =

Are you seeing a "missed schedule" error on your scheduled posts?

This plugin does one thing and does it well: it fixes the missed schedule error and triggers your scheduled posts to publish on time. We've developed this post scheduler plugin with performance in mind, so it won't affect the speed or performance of your website.

= What Causes the Missed Schedule Error? =

Having trouble with WordPress scheduled posts not publishing?

That's because scheduled posts are triggered to publish by something called "WordPress cron jobs". Cron is a technical term for commands that run on a scheduled time, like your scheduled posts in WordPress.

Technically, a real cron job will run at the server level. But because WordPress doesn't have access to that level, it runs a simulated cron.

These simulated cron jobs, like scheduled posts, are supposed to be triggered whenever a person or bot visits your site. But because it's not a real cron job, sometimes it causes a missed schedule error.

= How to Fix the Missed Schedule Error in WordPress =

Every fifteen minutes this post scheduler plugin checks for posts that have the missed schedule error, and will automatically publish them for you.

Multiple techniques for checking your site's missed posts are used to make sure a scheduled post is not missed.
